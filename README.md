Mod for [Desynced](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1450900)  
[Steam Workshop link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3535489538)

This mimics the skip mini game setting you can set on game creation, except this mod can be toggled at any point.

This replaces the [original Skip MiniGames mod by kma248](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3021964435), which is no longer maintained and breaks many explorables in the game.

This is written to be cleaner, future-proof and the least invasive possible.
